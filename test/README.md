#Unit Testing
Unit tests for Urchin are based on the catch.hpp file provided from https://github.com/philsquared/Catch.

Compiling and executing the main-test.cpp will run unit tests.  
Using the 'make' command inside the test directory will automatically generate a set of tests which can then be executed with the './test' instruction in the shell.
