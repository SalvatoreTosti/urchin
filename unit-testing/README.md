#Unit Testing
Unit tests for Urchin are based on the catch.hpp file provided from https://github.com/philsquared/Catch.

Compiling and executing the main-test.cpp will run unit tests.  
Note: The makefile in the unit-testing folder only cleans the unit-test and unit-test.o files, full recompilation has to be triggered seperately from the src folder makefile.
